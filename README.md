# DPLL
This repository displays a detailed construct of a Digital Phase Locked Loop made in Cadence Virtuoso.

## Elements involved in the Circuit
* Phase Frequency Detector
* Charge Pump
* Voltage Controlled Oscillator
* Divide by N (In this case, N = 3)
* Loop Filter

## The use of DPLL
Phase locked loops play a significant role in the modern-day circuits. They are used to demodulate the amplitude and frequency modulated signals, synchronize clocks, recover small signals from noise, and they are used in devices such as dual-tone multiple frequency decoders and modems.
